# Project 1: Write a Data Science Blog Post.
Analysis of the AirBnb database in Boston in order to write a blog post with the main findings.

## Libraries:
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Descartes
- Geopandas
- Shapely

## Files:
- **Project1.ipynb**: Main file containing the data gathering, data wrangling and data analysis process, as well as the main results.
- **boston-airbnb-open-data/**: Folder containing the database that is imported in the project.
- __bos_land.\*__: Shape files for the map of Boston.

## Main Results:
The analysis gave three main results regarding to what is the influence that some variables have in the occupancy rate of the Airbnb places.
- Even when the location of the place within the city seems to be irrelevant because in every area of the city it is possible to find places with all levels of occupancy, it is interesting that the highest rates are slightly more concentrated in the north of the area which is the most centric part of the city.
- In contrast with what we might think, that the price is very relevant. It turns out that different values of occupancy rate can be found at every price levels. It seems to have a very homogene distribution.
- Looking at the review scores value it is possible to see that most of the evaluations from the people are values higher than 6 in a scale from 1 to 10. So concentrating the analysis in this side of the values it is possible to identify a tendency to a higher occupancy rate in average among the highly rated places.

The main findings are explained in more details in the following article.
